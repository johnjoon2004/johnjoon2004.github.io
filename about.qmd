**Introduction**
I'm an unremarkable AI researcher/engineer, full of contradictions — an introvert and an attention-seeker; a perfectionist and a procrastinator; a principled rule-follower who prefers the unconventional; a mix of narcissism and self-criticism — all bundled up in a cloud of uncertainty. Honestly, I don't even have a clear grasp of myself. But if there's one thing I can be sure about, it's that anyone who has ever tried to guess my MBTI has never failed to see that it's INTJ.

**Contributing**
The low-quality sentences are written by me, and the well-written posts are gracefully given by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/).
